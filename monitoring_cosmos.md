# Monitoring a Cosmos chain validator
###### *created Sep 22, 2022; last updated Sep 22, 2022*

----

### What should we be watching for if we're invested in a Cosmos validator?
1. Security monitoring
    - compromised signing keys
    - compomised accounts
    - compromised infrastructure
2. Liveness metrics
    - server metrics (connectivity, hardware resource use, bandwidth resource use, daemon status)
    - crypto network metrics: failing to sign pre-commits
    - crypto events: dropped rank; jailed;
3. Crypto metrics
    - economic metrics & events
4. Social events & metrics
    - emergencies triggered by core devs
    - governance proposals

Some of these events/metrics should get our attention immediately, while others we may track to review at regularly scheduled intervals.

### What kinds of alerts are there?
1. **Strong alert** wakes you up out of bed for an emergency 
2. **Mid alert** gets your attention outside of normal work hours, giving you time to avoid an emergency
3. **Soft alert** gets your attention during working hours
4. **Tracked** gives no alert, but recorded to review at regularly scheduled intervals

Who gets alerted and how? How can the alertee get additional help if they need it? How should the alertee document an event?

There are certain events and conditions that we want to track, and there are thresholds or events that we want notifications for.
In some cases we'll want to be notified immediately (like wake up, there's an emergency). In other cases we'll want a softer warning, so
maybe we'll address the issue at the beginning of the set of working hours. Finally, we may want to collect data for a regular 
review on the health and performance of our operations.

### What to watch and why?
**(work in progress)**

1. Accounts
2. Operations
3. Broader network
4. what else are we missing?

### When should we be alerted and how?
